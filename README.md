# PDF Interaction Interface: Streamlit Application
## Introduction

"PDF Interaction Interface" is a Streamlit-based web application designed to facilitate interactive Q&A sessions using content extracted from PDF documents. Utilizing advanced natural language processing techniques and Google Generative AI, this application allows users to upload PDF documents, process them, and pose questions whose answers are derived directly from the uploaded material.

The "Gemini Image Demo" is a Streamlit-based web application that utilizes image processing with textual input to produce insightful descriptions of the image. Utilizing the power of Google's Gemini AI, this application is specifically tailored to understand and interpret invoices, enabling users to upload an image of an invoice and receive detailed, context-aware descriptions based on their textual queries.

## Features
### PDF Interaction Interface
**PDF Upload:** Users can upload one or multiple PDF files.<br>
**Text Extraction:** Extracts text from the uploaded PDF documents.<br>
**Text Chunking:** Splits the extracted text into manageable chunks for processing.<br>
**Vector Store Creation:** Generates embeddings for text chunks and stores them in ChromaDB for efficient retrieval.<br>
**Interactive Q&A:** Users can ask questions and receive answers based on the content of the uploaded PDFs.<br>

### Gemini Image Demo
**Image Upload:** Supports uploading of images, particularly invoices, in formats like jpg, jpeg, and png.<br>
**AI-Powered Analysis:** Integrates Google's Gemini AI to interpret the uploaded invoice images.<br>
**Interactive Querying:** Users can input text prompts to ask specific questions about the uploaded invoice image.<br>
**Responsive Output:** Generates detailed responses combining the context of the image with the user's text input.<br>
